# what i did 

It seems we're having persistent issues with the development environment. Here's what I recommend:
For the server setup, we have two options:
Use Docker Desktop for Windows and enable WSL integration (recommended)
Set up a local PostgreSQL server on Windows and connect to it from WSL
For now, I suggest we move on to implementing the Android client component while we resolve the server environment issues. The server code is complete and properly structured, but we need to resolve the environment setup issues.
